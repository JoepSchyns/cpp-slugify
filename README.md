# ðŸ”¨ C++ Slugify
Modern header-only C++ library to slugify a string

## Installation

Just drop the slugify.hpp in your project and use it.
You'll need a modern C++11 compatible compiler though.

## Usage

```cpp
#include "slugify.hpp";

std::string test = slugify("This is a test!");
// This-is-a-test
```
